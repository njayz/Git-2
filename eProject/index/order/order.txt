                <p>Designers like Brandon Maxwell and Burberry flirted with the idea of taking your favorite accessories and shrinking them into pieces no bigger than your palms.
                    The runways were dotted with miniature crossbody bags that probably hold nothing more than a few coins.
                    While highly impractical, these tiny purses are dainty and cute for special occasions.
